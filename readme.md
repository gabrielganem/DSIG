# DATASIG - AMBIENTE DE GESTÃO E ANÁLISE DE DADOS CIENTÍFICOS GEORREFERENCIADOS ATRAVÉS DE REDE SEMÂNTICA


The function of a geographic information system (GIS) is to provide a spatial model to assist in decision making for the use of terrestrial resources or to manage the man-made environment. A georeferenced database model brings the logical data model closer to the actual model. Objects in a georeferenced database are generally the same objects that would be defined in a logical model, such as administrators, buildings, highways, and other constructs.
Of the advantages, one has a uniform repository of geographic data. All georeferenced data present at the University from previous surveys can be centrally stored and mana- ged in only one database. In addition, data entry and editing is more accurate because, in addition to setting a standard for this, the use of data validation allows even fewer errors.
A Semantic Network is a set of standards and good practices for data distribution and their meanings over the internet for use in various applications.
This work presents an environment of management and analysis of georeferenced data allied to a computational model of Semantic Network.
